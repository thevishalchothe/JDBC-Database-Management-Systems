## **What is JDBC-Database-Management-Systems?** 🌐

The **JDBC-Database-Management-Systems** is a collection of projects demonstrating **JDBC operations** in Java. These projects focus on various methods of interacting with databases, ensuring secure, efficient, and scalable database management. The system utilizes **JDBC Statements** (including `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, and `CallableStatement`) to perform **CRUD operations** in a database.

The following examples demonstrate **Student Management**, **Book Management**, and **Product Management**, each showing different approaches for querying and manipulating data.

## **Architecture** 🏗️

The **JDBC-Database-Management-Systems** is designed with modularity, with each system handling a specific part of the database operations:

#### 1) **Student Management System 📚**
The **Student Management** focuses on managing student records using the `Statement` interface to execute static SQL queries. 

#### 2) **Book Management System 📖**
The **Book Management** uses the `PreparedStatement` interface to perform parameterized queries. It allows safer and more efficient interactions with the database by preventing SQL injection and improving performance.

#### 3) **Product Management System 🛒**
The **Product Management** uses the `CallableStatement` interface to interact with stored procedures. This service is ideal for performing operations that require reusable SQL logic stored in the database, such as complex product queries.

## **How It Works 🛠️**

1. **Student Management** utilizes the `Statement` interface to execute SQL queries for basic CRUD operations like adding, updating, and retrieving student data.
2. **Book Management** leverages the `PreparedStatement` interface for secure, parameterized SQL queries to handle book details and queries.
3. **Product Management** takes advantage of `CallableStatement` to interact with stored procedures, allowing for more complex operations and optimizations on the database side.
