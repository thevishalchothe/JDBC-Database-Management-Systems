# JDBC-Database-Management-Systems 📡

**JDBC-Database-Management-Systems** is a collection of projects demonstrating JDBC operations in Java. It includes:

- **Student Management** using the `Statement` Interface.
- **Book Management** using `PreparedStatement`.
- **Product Management** with `CallableStatement`.

These projects showcase various approaches for interacting with databases securely and efficiently.

## Overview 🔍

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API that enables communication between Java applications and database applications. It provides a set of classes, methods, and interfaces that facilitate connecting to a database, executing SQL queries, and retrieving results.

JDBC is a **database-independent** API, meaning you can use it to connect to any relational database like MySQL, Oracle, etc. JDBC is written in Java and typically works with **Type-4 JDBC drivers**, which are fully implemented in Java.

JDBC is used for performing **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on databases, such as inserting, deleting, updating, and retrieving data.

## Why Use JDBC? 🤔

Using JDBC in Java provides several benefits:

- 📂 **Efficient data storage and management** compared to using file systems.
- 📊 **Store and manage large amounts of data** in relational tables.
- 🔗 **Maintain relationships** between Java objects and relational database tables.
- 🧑‍💻 **Efficient querying and sorting** of data.

## Key JDBC Interfaces and Classes ⚙️

JDBC provides the following important interfaces and classes for interacting with databases:

- **DriverManager**: Manages a list of database drivers.
- **Connection**: Interface that provides methods for contacting a database.
- **Statement**: Interface used to submit SQL queries to the database.
- **ResultSet**: Interface that holds data retrieved from the database after executing an SQL query using Statement objects.
